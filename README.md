## Challeng
You must create a simple application, with 4 different implementation of “Numbers” using HTML, Sass and JavaScript, and a Jsfiddle tool. 
The user must have an option to choose between the 4 implementations (versions of the game), enter a number from 1 to 1000.
Your application, then, must display the result of all implementations to the user. For this task, you must use at least two of the SOLID principles.

1 - Even or odd.

2 - Prime number or not.

3 - Show if the number exists in the Fibonacci sequence.

4 - Show the sequence of numbers where multiples of 4 use the word “pin”.
